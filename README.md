Tic Tac Toe
-----------

This is a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the command line. This game is programmed so that the computer will never lose, even though the user is given the advantage of starting first each game. The user is always "X", and the computer is always "O". The user is able to enter a number from 1 - 9 to chose which position they'd like their "X" to go. The board is numbered as follows:


1 | 2 | 3
--- | --- | ---
**4** | **5** | **6**
**7** | **8** | **9**

To install this game, clone this git repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/elizabethengelman/tic-tac-toe.git
```


Once you're in the directory, just type in "ruby play_ttt.rb" into the command line to begin playing. 

```
cd tictactoe
ruby play_ttt.rb
```
Have fun!

NOTE: This is my second attempt at TTT, and includes testing with Rspec.
